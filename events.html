         <h4>Lotus Lantern Festival</h4>
         <p>Lotus Lantern Festival (Yeon Deung Hoe Festival) is an annual festival associated with the Buddha’s birthday celebrations. This festival takes place in all countries where Buddhist temples are located, but the main celebrations take place in South Korea, where this tradition has over 1300 years of history. The first celebration of the Buddha’s birth took place during the Silla Dynasty.

         Currently, more than half of Koreans declare as atheists, and Buddhists constitute the second denominational group after Protestants. Even though Buddhism is not even considered a religion, Buddha’s birthday is a day off for all Koreans. The Lotus Lantern Festival is so deeply rooted in the local culture that it is considered the intangible national heritage of Korea.Several days before the Lantern Festival – colourful lanterns are being hung not only in temples but also in all cities. They decorate not only the area of the temples but also the road that leads to them. In cities, lanterns hang along main streets and on the largest squares. In Seoul, they were also hung along the entire Cheonggyecheon Stream, which is a tourist attraction in itself.
