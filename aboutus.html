			<h2>ABOUT SEOUL</h2>
			<p>Seoul, officially the Seoul Special City, is South Korea's capital and largest metropolis. Seoul has a population of 9.7 million people and serves as the heart of the Seoul Capital Area, along with the surround Incheon metropolis and Gyeonggi province. In 2014, Seoul was the world's fourth-largest metropolitan economy, trailing only Tokyo, New York City, and Los Angeles. Seoul had the sixth highest cost of living in the world in 2017.

            Wiryeseong, the capital of Baekje (founded in 18 BC) in modern-day Seoul, was the first city to be recorded. Several city walls from this era still stand in the area. Pungnaptoseong, an earthen wall in southeast Seoul, is widely assumed to be the main Wiryeseong site. As the Three Kingdoms competed for control of this strategic region, control passed from Baekje to Goguryeo in the 5th century, and from Goguryeo to Silla in the 6th century.
            Originally, the city was completely encircled by a massive circular stone wall to protect its inhabitants from wild animals, thieves, and attacks. Although the wall no longer exists (except along Bugaksan Mountain (Korean: ; Hanja: ), north of the downtown area), the gates remain near the downtown district of Seoul, most notably Sungnyemun (commonly known as Namdaemun) and Heunginjimun (commonly known as Dongdaemun). The gates were opened and closed every day during the Joseon dynasty, accompanied by the ringing of large bells at the Bosingak belfry. After hundreds of years of isolation, Seoul opened its doors to foreigners and began to modernize in the late nineteenth century. Seoul was the first city in East Asia to install electricity in the royal palace, which was built by the Edison Illuminating Company, and a decade later Seoul also installed electrical street lights.
