				<h4>Jogyesa Temple</h4>
				<p>This will probably be the most colourful temple you will ever see – the exterior is bright red, jade, blue and yellow. Inside are three golden Buddhas. As the visual fanfare suggests, the chief temple of the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism is one of the most important in the country.</p>

				<h4>Namdaemun Market, Seoul</h4>
				<p>The largest traditional market in Korea, Namdaemun Market is the place to shop for cheap goods as well as fresh fruit and vegetables. It is also the perfect spot to graze – don’t miss the spicy tteokbokki rice cakes or the mung-bean pancakes, prepared while you wait. The market is open through the night from 11pm to 4am</p>

				<h4>Gwanghwamun Square</h4>

The square features a statue of King Sejong the Great, the inventor of Korea’s Hangul alphabet.

				<h4>Gyeongbokgung</h4>
				<p>Painted in hues of red and jade, Gyeongbokgung is the largest and arguably the most important. Often compared with the Forbidden City in Beijing, Gyeongbokgung also houses the National Folk Museum of Korea. If you wear hanbok, the traditional Korean dress for men and women, your visit is free. You can rent your costumes in the city</p>

				<h4>Bukhansan National Park</h4>
				<p>South Korea is only the size of the US state of Kentucky yet it manages to squeeze in 22 national parks. One of these is Bukhansan, just beyond the outskirts of Seoul. It is a great place for leisurely hikers: make it up the lush Bukhansan Mountain at your own pace to discover an amazing view of the city</p>
