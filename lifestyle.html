         <h4>Cheonggyecheon Stream</h4>
         <p>
            Cheonggyecheon Stream is an 11 km-long stream that runs through downtown Seoul. Created as part of an urban renewal project, Cheonggyecheon Stream is a restoration of the stream that was once there during the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910). The stream was covered with an elevated highway after the Korean War (1950-1953), as part of the country's post-war economic development. Then in 2003, the elevated highway was removed to restore the stream to its present form today. The stream starts from Cheonggye Plaza, a popular cultural arts venue, and passes under a total of 22 bridges before flowing into the Hangang River, with many attractions along the way.



Cheonggyecheon’s turbulent history is on display at the Cheonggyecheon Museum, which opened in September 2005. The museum offers visitors the chance to learn about the many changes the stream has seen, including being buried underground and being restored. The story is told with the help of a scale-model and period photographs.
